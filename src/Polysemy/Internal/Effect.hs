-- | The class for semantic effects.
--
-- An effect @e@ is a type @e m a@, where the other types are given by:
--
-- * The @m@ type variable corresponds to a monad, which will eventually be
-- instantiated at 'Polysemy.Sem'---meaning it is capable of encoding
-- arbitrary other effects.
--
-- * The @a@ type is handled automatically and uninteresting.
--
-- The type @e m@ must be a 'Functor', but this instance can always be given
-- for free via the @-XDeriveFunctor@ language extension. Often this instance
-- must be derived as a standalone (@-XStandaloneDeriving@):
--
-- @
-- deriving instance Functor (MyEffect m)
-- @
--
-- If the effect doesn't use @m@ whatsoever it is said to be /first-order/.
-- First-order effects can be given an instance of 'Effect' for free with
-- @-XDeriveAnyClass@.
--
-- @
-- deriving instance Effect MyEffect

class Effect e where
  -- | Provide a specialised version of 'fmap' to work around versions of GHC
  -- that cannot express the quantified constraint '(∀ m. Functor m => Functor (e m))'
  --
  -- This must always be equal to 'fmap', and can be removed once GHC 8.6 is the
  -- minimum version supported by this library

  default fmap' :: Functor (e m) => (a -> b) -> (e m a -> e m b)

  -- | Higher-order effects require the ability to distribute state from other
  -- effects throughout themselves. This state is given by an initial piece of
  -- state @s ()@, and a distributive law that describes how to move the state
  -- through an effect.
  --
  -- When the effect @e@ has multiple computations in the @m@ monad, 'weave'
  -- defines the semantics for how these computations will view with the state:
  --
  -- * If the resulting state from one computation is fed to another, the second
  -- computation will see the state that results from the first computation.
  --
  -- * If instead it is given the intial state, both computations will see the
  -- same state, but the result of (at least) one will necessarily be ignored.
